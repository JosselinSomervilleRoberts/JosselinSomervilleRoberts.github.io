                'After a trip to Vegas, I was fascinated by BlackJack and I decided that I wanted to study the optimal strategy to this game. In addition I wanted to check how effective counting cards was (with the classic high/low count) and how to optimize the betting strategy based on the true count and the player\'s capital.',
                'The first step was to implement a fast balckjack simulation. While a simple way to do this would have been to simply draw some random cards, I wanted to do something more complex that would actually simulate how blackjack is played in a casino. Most simulations assume that there are 52 times the number of decks cards and then simply draw cards from this. In reality, in a casino a game will be played with lesss and less card available until the penetration amount is reached and the cards are shuffled. In addition, there are other players at the table that also draw cards. I wanted to simulate this to be as accurate as possible. As an example I often read some articles doing something similar but with many errors such as applying a Monte-Carlo estimation of the probabilities given a current state. Let\'s say you ahve a score of 17 and the dealer shows an 8, what should you do. Well most simulations randomly draw cards without taking into account the fact that we know the hand of the player as well as one card of the dealer. This changes the distribution of the cards in the deck and therefore it was needed to take this into account.',
                'Another thing that I wanted to do was simulate the full rules of black jack. Most simulations only account for the Hit and Stand actions while all advantage players know that the three other actions: Split, Double and Surrender are the ones that enable the player to nearly play a zero-sum game without counting (with the optimal strategy the loss is of about 0.50%) and to win money if counting (a few percent).',
                'With this simulation, I was able to design a Q-learning agent to optimize for an optimal strategy without counting the cards. Q-learning was well suited for this as the action space simply consists of 5 actions, and the state space is quite small (11 possibilities for the dealer, 17 possible counts for the player (excluding BlackJack as no action is needed), and a few boolean variables to express the player\'s options: can split, can double, can surrender, is soft).',
                'My first goal was to first check that I was able to find the optimal strategy (that you can find online). So I trained my agent and showed the optimal actions and the Q-values (to show the expected return). You can see the result below:',

                'The next step was to add counting. This simply consisted of adding the high/low count to the player\'s state. I was then able to compute the optimal strategy (as above) for each value of the count. In addition I was able to compute the expected gain under the optimal solution for a given count. As expected when the true count is high, the player can expect to make some profit (up to 20%). The graph below shows this:',
